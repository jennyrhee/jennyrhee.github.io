### PROJECTS

**Severe Storm Events in Louisiana**
• *(In progress)* Using two NOAA data sets (severe storm events and meteorological) for EDA and modeling storm events in Louisiana
• Technologies used: Python (BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, NumPy, pandarallel), SQLite

### SKILLS

**Languages**: Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), SQL, MATLAB, Java  
**Tools**: Git, Microsoft SQL Server, VS Code  
**Technical skills**: Machine learning (scikit-learn), experimental design, statistics, NLP (NLTK), time series (statsmodels)

### RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

**Research Associate** - Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA <span style="float: right; ">June 2019 to present</span>  
• Compiling data from various sources to build an econometric model to analyze the effects of driving forces on a variety of environmental impacts in the U.S. and Germany over the past two centuries  
• Developing a simulation model in Python to illustrate the relationship between embodied energy and fitness of a K-selected species  
_Technologies used: Python, Excel_

**Data Analyst Intern** - Acadian Ambulance, Lafayette, LA <span style="float: right; ">Aug 2018 to May 2019</span>  
• Led the first data science projects to be conducted at the company  
• Exploratory analysis (clustering using scikit-learn and topic modeling using Gensim and MALLET) of rejected medical records to categorize and understand the common reasons for rejection  
• Analyzed the “virality” of medics with low medical documentation accuracy on their partners with the goal of changing training procedures  
• Time series analysis (statsmodels) to forecast future daily numbers of billable calls for more efficient medic scheduling recommendations to operations managers  
_Technologies used: Python, T-SQL, Microsoft SQL Server_  

**Great Lakes Summer Fellow** - University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI <span style="float: right; ">May to Aug 2018</span>  
• Proposed a data management solution for 15 stations and buoys in the Great Lakes. Data were in inconsistent formats and units over time and between stations, ranged over a decade, and stored as flat text files on a server.  
• Analyzed real-time data from 15 stations and buoys in the Great Lakes, their formats, and documentation  
• Developed a data processing script in Python to normalize historical time-series data into a database  
• Designed and implemented a time-series database (TimescaleDB) to manage historical and real-time streaming data from the Great Lakes  
_Technologies used: Python, TimescaleDB_  

**NSF REU Fellow** - Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Dauphin Island, AL <span style="float: right; ">May to Aug 2017</span>  
• Collaborated with a physical oceanographer and biological oceanographer to design an experiment using existing data that had yet to be analyzed  
• Processed, sanitized, and compiled several  years (2009-2012) of CTD data from 15 stations  
• Calculated Model-I linear regressions and statistics to make conclusions about the Mobile Bay to shelf transect  
• Won 1st place in the REU poster symposium, awarding full funding to present research at Ocean Sciences Meeting in Portland, OR  
_Technologies used: MATLAB, SeaBird SBE Data Processing, Excel_  
  
### EDUCATION

Springboard  
**Data Science Career Track, Certification**, July 2019 to present  
• 6 month intensive course in data science, data visualization, machine learning, Python, SQL, and Spark
_Estimated completion: November 2019_

University of Louisiana at Lafayette  
**B.S. Biology**, May 2018  
• Relevant coursework: Advanced Data Structures and Software Engineering, Linear Algebra, Calculus I and II
