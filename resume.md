### RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

**Marketing Analyst** - Waitr, Lafayette, LA
<span style="float:right; ">November 2019 to present</span>  
• Tracked and analyzed the performance of marketing campaigns (push notifications, emails)  
• Designed statistically rigorous A/B tests and analyzed results to optimize marketing campaigns  
• RFM customer segmentation using k-means clustering and quartile bucketing  
• Identified an approximately $1M per year stream of cannibalized revenue from coupon fraud  
• Analyzed the order behavior effects of a loyalty program (+200% average orders per year) leading to program redesign with the goal of increasing customer penetration and engagement  
• Created a marketing dashboard to track weekly KPIs and wrote scripts to automate complex data retrieval  
• Worked with the sales and business intelligence teams to research restaurants not yet on the app and scraped data that was necessary for restaurant acquisition efforts  
_Technologies used: Python, AWS Redshift, PostgreSQL, Tableau, Sisense, Braze, Leanplum_

**Research Associate** - Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA <span style="float: right; ">June 2019 to November 2019</span>  
• Compiled data from various sources to build an econometric model to analyze the effects of driving forces on a variety of environmental impacts in the U.S. and Germany over the past two centuries  
• Developing a simulation model in Python to illustrate the relationship between embodied energy and fitness of a K-selected species  
_Technologies used: Python, Excel_

**Data Analyst Intern** - Acadian Ambulance, Lafayette, LA <span style="float: right; ">Aug 2018 to May 2019</span>  
• Led the first data science projects to be conducted at the company  
• Exploratory analysis (clustering using scikit-learn and topic modeling using Gensim and MALLET) of rejected medical records to categorize and understand the common reasons for rejection  
• Analyzed the “virality” of medics with low medical documentation accuracy on their partners with the goal of changing training procedures  
_Technologies used: Python, Microsoft SQL Server_  

**Great Lakes Summer Fellow** - University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI <span style="float: right; ">May to Aug 2018</span>  
• Developed a data processing script in Python to normalize historical time-series data into a database  
• Proposed a data management solution for 15 stations and buoys in the Great Lakes. Data were in inconsistent formats and units over time and between stations, ranged over a decade, and stored as flat text files on a server.  
• Designed and implemented a time-series database (TimescaleDB) to manage historical and real-time streaming data from the Great Lakes  
_Technologies used: Python, TimescaleDB_  

**NSF REU Fellow** - Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Dauphin Island, AL <span style="float: right; ">May to Aug 2017</span>  
• Won 1st place in the REU poster symposium, awarding full funding to present research at Ocean Sciences Meeting in Portland, OR  
• Collaborated with a physical oceanographer and biological oceanographer to design an experiment using existing data that had yet to be analyzed  
• Processed, sanitized, and compiled several  years (2009-2012) of CTD data from 15 stations  
• Calculated Model-I linear regressions and statistics to make conclusions about the Mobile Bay to shelf transect  
_Technologies used: MATLAB, SeaBird SBE Data Processing, Excel_
