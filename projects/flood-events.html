            <h3>Purpose and Goal</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first capstone project for the Springboard Data
                Science bootcamp. The goal was to build a model 
                that is capable of taking in forecast data and return the likelihood 
                of a flood event occurring in Louisiana. The major phases were data
                cleaning, exploratory analysis, and training the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page contains a high level overview, but a more detailed
                report can be found
                <a href="https://github.com/jennyrhee/flood-events/blob/master/docs/final-report.md">here</a>.

            <h4>Data Sources</h4>
            <p>
                NWS provided 
                <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncdc-storm-events-database">storm data</a>
                containing statistics on personal injuries and damage estimates from
                1950 to present. There were 34 different storm events including various
                types of floods, hurricanes, thunderstorms, hail, etc.
                There were 51 columns including damage, injuries, deaths, etc.
                I used Python scripts to download all 213 csv files, create a database, 
                and ingest the data into the database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional supporting data included historical meteorological data
                to analyze any potential correlations. NOAA's National Centers for
                Environmental Information had
                <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation/">Daily Summaries data</a>
                at numerous stations across the United States. This data included
                air temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.

            <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
            <p>
                There were 668 flash floods, 132 floods, and 11 coastal
                floods in the dataset. NWS provided 
                <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/pd01016005curr.pdf">documentation</a>
                defining the storm events recorded in the database.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        flash flood: life-threatening, rapid rise of water
                        into a normally dry area beginning within minutes
                        to multiple hours of the causative event (e.g., 
                        intense rainfall, dam failure, ice jam)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        flood: any high flow, overflow, or inundation by
                        water which causes damage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        coastal flood: flooding of coastal areas due to
                        vertical rise above normal water level caused by
                        strong, persistent onshore wind, high astronomical
                        tide, and/or low atmospheric pressure
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The first feature I wanted to check out was precipitation,
                which I expected to be the most important feature for the model.
            </p>

              <img class="project-img" src="images/flood_precip-box.png" alt="A box plot showing the distributions of precipitation by flood type"/>
            </div>

            <p>
              Wind speed was another anticipated feature of interest because these events are
              caused by coastal processes such as waves, tides, and storm surges, which are
              strongly influenced by wind.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The following image is the correlation matrix.
                The grey area indicates relationships that are with themselves (e.g., 
                `avg_wind_spd` vs. `avg_wind_spd`, etc.), relationships that are 
                nonsensical (e.g., region vs. season, etc.), or repeating values 
                (e.g., `prcp` vs. `avg_wind_spd` shown only once). Any relationships 
                that were not statistically significant were also greyed out. 
            </p>

            </div>

            <h4>Model</h4>
            <p>
                Two classification algorithms were used: logistic regression
                and random forest. Both algorithms were beneficial because 
                they are both generally easy to interpret, allowing for easier
                stakeholder communication. Logistic regression was selected because
                it is the go-to method for binary classification problems. Random 
                forest was selected because it works well with fitting categorical
                features and high dimensional data. Random forest performed the best
                with an F-2 score of 0.839 compared to logistic regressionâ€™s F-2 
                score of 0.836. Hyperparameter tuning was done with cross-validated grid search.

            <h4>Issues and Potential Improvements</h4>
            <p>
                Data cleaning and joining the two data sets together were the trickiest
                parts of this project.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The storm events data used parish to indicate location of the event,
                    but several data points were not exact parish names and had to be 
                    cleaned to be one of the distinct 64 parishes in the state
                </li>
                <li>
                    The meteorological data did not include parishes for each
                    station, which was how I joined it with the storm events data.
                    Had to use an API to query for each parish based on coordinates
                    of each station. Then the station data was aggregated to represent
                    the parish in its entirety by taking the mean of all data points
                    for stations within each station for each date
                </li>
                <li>
                    The data was sparse; when the storm events and meteorological data
                    were joined, there were only 2,202 flood events, of which only 812
                    data points had complete meteorological data. A better data set
                    would improve the model's capability to predict flood events
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Further data exploration could be done in order to find other data 
                sources or potentially feature engineering to strengthen the model.
                Predictive weather models are exceptionally complex, and there is
                likely much more that can be done to develop a stronger model with
                a higher F-2 score. Additionally, a web application could be
                developed to allow access for use by stakeholders.
