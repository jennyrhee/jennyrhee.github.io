            Predicting sentiment from tweets<br />

            <h3>Purpose and Goal</h3>
            <p>
              This was my second capstone project for the Springboard Data
              Science bootcamp. The goal was to train a model to predict
              sentiment and develop a web app that can be used to monitor the
              current sentiment of various airlines day-to-day and display
              representative tweets. The major phases were data cleaning,
              exploratory analysis, training the model, and developing the web
              app. During this project, I was able to learn some methods to
              deploying a machine learning model to a web app and some basic web
              development skills!
            </p>
            <p>
              This page contains a high level overview, but a more detailed
              report can be found
              <a href="https://github.com/jennyrhee/airline-sentiment/blob/main/docs/final-report.pdf">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design was TwoColours, a free, fully standards-compliant CSS
              template designed by
              <a href="http://templated.co" rel="nofollow">TEMPLATED</a>. The
              website was previously hosted on Heroku, but has been taken down
              since they removed their free account tier; I was already paying
              $5 a month on Git LFS storage for the models. :(

            <p style="font-size: 0.85em">
              Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn,
              Flask, Plotly, Tweepy), Heroku
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h4>Data Sources</h4>
            <p>
              The data came from
              <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/">Figure Eight</a>,
              who provides high quality training data to solve various
              machine learning problems, and can be found
              <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment">here</a>. 
              Once the model was trained, Twitter data came from the API to
              determine the current sentiment of different airlines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additional features were created from the original tweets: the
              total character count, the number of capital letters, the capital
              letter to character count ratio, the number of words, the number
              of happy emoticons, the number of sad emoticons, the number of
              exclamation marks, and the number of question marks.
            </p>

            <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              Unsurprisingly, the general trend was that most people tweeted
              about an airline for negative reasons. Positive and neutral tweets
              were much less common, which likely impacted the model's accuracy
              due to imbalanced classes.
            </p>

              <img class="project-img" src="images/sentiment-proportions.png" alt="A graph that shows the proportions of negative, positive, and neutral tweets by airline"/>
            </div>

            <p>
              For all airlines, customer service issues were a consistent
              problem. However, it should be noted that it was not the most
              frequent negative reason for Delta, which was late flights.
              America, Southwest, and US Airways also had common complaints
              regarding cancelled flights. Virgin America and Delta differed
              from the other airlines because their third top reason was about
              bad flights.

            </div>

            <p>
              The correlation values for sentiment_int vs. the other features
              were calculated using the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_ratio">correlation ratio</a>, 
              which ranges from 0 to 1.

            <h4>Model</h4>
            <p>
              Two classification algorithms were used to compare performance
              with tf-idf vectorizer: Naive Bayes and random forest. Naive Bayes
              performed significantly worse than random forest; the mean
              accuracy score for Naive Bayes was 0.679 versus 0.763 for random
              forest. The bag-of-words model was then compared to tf-idf, which
              had a mean accuracy score of 0.757 vs. 0.763 for tf-idf. The
              hyperparameters for the final model were optimized using
              randomized search.

            <h4>Issues and Potential Improvements</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Didn't have any web development experience prior to this
                project, so that was a little bit of a learning curve (mainly
                figuring out Flask and Heroku since the design was primarily
                from a template)
              </li>
              <li>
                Ran into issues with the file sizes of the pickled models when
                trying to upload them to Github (had to pay for a data pack to
                use Git LFS storage in order to upload them)
              </li>
              <li>
                Somewhat of a performance issue once the website was live
                because the Heroku dyno was much slower than my machine, so the
                model took longer to predict sentiment (not a great user
                experience)
              </li>
              <li>
                The model could also certainly use improvements since there was
                not much data for neutral and positive tweets, so it didn't
                perform as well for those
              </li>
