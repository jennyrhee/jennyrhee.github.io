	<p>My name is Jenny Rhee, and I am an aspiring data scientist based in Lafayette, LA. I was originally pursuing marine biology, but discovered my love for data and programming during a summer internship in 2017.</p>
  <p>I hope to one day have the opportunity to use data science to solve problems involving renewable energy and climate policy. Other than that, I enjoy coffee, food, hiking, traveling (especially if it involves trying new coffee and food), and my dog Watson. Feel free to reach out!</p>
